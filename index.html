                  <h5>Financial</h5>
                  <p>The Doubling Time formula is used in finance and by financial institutions to calculate the length of time required to double an investment or money in an interest bearing account.

                  <div id="doubling-time-info" class="collapse">
                    <p>It is important to note that r variable in the doubling time formula is the rate per period. If one needs to calculate the amount of time to double their money in a money market account that is compounded monthly, then the r variable needs to express the monthly rate and not the annual rate. The monthly rate can be found by dividing the annual rate by 12. With this situation, the doubling time formula will give the number of months that it takes to double money and not years.</p>
                    <p>In addition to expressing r as the monthly rate if the account is compounded monthly, one could also use the effective annual rate, or annual percentage yield, as r in the doubling time formula. This particular calculator is used to calculate the monthly rate and not the annual rate.</p>

                  <h5>Financial</h5>
                  <p>The investment turnover measurement is used by investors to determine the ability of a company to convert its debt and equity into dollars of sales. A high ratio of sales to equity and debt indicates a high level of efficiency in creating sales while a low ratio of sales to equity and debt indicates a poor level of efficiency in creating sales.

                    <p>The investment turnover measure should be tracked on a trend line to see if there are changes in the level of sales efficiency over time.</p>
                    <p>To find the investment turnover, divide total sales by the combination of stockholders’ equity and long-term liabilities. In cases where debt is coming due in the short term, and therefore is categorized as a short-term liability, it is also acceptable to include it in the denominator.</p>

                    <p>To find the break-even point, divide the average gross margin percentage into total operating costs.

                    <p>Now find feasible suggestions by trying different increases. Remember that the Google suggestions provide the number of projected clicks by week, so you must multiply that number by 4 to remain in the monthly calculation.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, do simple division on the current and projected sets of numbers to see increases. Divide suggested budget by current budget. Then divide projected users by current users. And divide projected leads by current leads.</p>

                    <p>There are two ways to measure the gross margin. The most common approach is to add together the costs of overhead, direct materials, and direct labor; subtract the total from revenue; and then divide the result by revenue. This approach takes into account all costs that can be reasonably associated with the production process.</p>
                    <p>The trouble with this approach is that many of the production costs are not truly variable. Under a much more strictly defined view of variable costs, only direct materials should be included in the formula, since this is the only cost that truly changes in proportion with changes in revenue. All other production costs are then shifted into other operational and administrative costs, which typically yields a high gross margin percentage.</p>

One way some try to visualize the concept of continuous compounding is that is fluid, constantly compounding moment by moment, as opposed to daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. The question a few sentences above regarding 'How much will I have saved' must also take into consideration how often interest is compounded in the interest bearing account.</p>

The remaining 13% represent the lender's haircut, adding up to 100% and being covered from the borrower's equity. The higher the LTV ratio, the riskier the loan is for a lender.</p>
                    <p>The valuation of a property is typically determined by an appraiser, but a better measure is an arms-length transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller.

                    <p>The GRM is useful for comparing and selecting investment properties where depreciation effects, periodic costs (such as property taxes and insurance) and costs to the investor incurred by a potential renter (such as utilities and repairs) can be expected to be uniform across the properties (either as uniform values or uniform fractions of the gross rental income) or insignificant in comparison to gross rental income. As these costs are also often more difficult to predict than market rental return, the GRM serves as an alternative to a measure of net investment return where such a measure would be difficult to determine.</p>

                  <p>The average collection period formula is the number of days in a period divided by the receivables turnover ratio. The typical collection period is 365 calendar days.

                    <p>The numerator of the average collection period formula shown at the top of the page is 365 days. For many situations, an annual review of the average collection period is considered. However, if the receivables turnover is evaluated for a different time period, then the numerator should reflect this same time period.</p>
                    <p>For example, if the receivables turnover for one year is 8, then the average collection period would be 45.63 days. If the period considered is instead for 180 days with a receivables turnover of 4.29, then the average collection period would be 41.96 days. By the nature of the formula, a company will have a lower receivables turnover when a shorter time period is considered due to having a larger portion of its revenues awaiting receipt in the short run.</p>

                  <h5>Accounting</h5>
                  <p>In some industries, a key barrier to entry is the large amount of asset required to produce revenues. By using the sales to fixed assets ratio, one can see if a company is investing a great deal of money in assets in order to generate sales.

                  <div id="sales-assets-ratio-info" class="collapse">
                    <p>This is a particularly effective measure when compared to the same ratio for other companies in the same industry; that is, if another company has found a way to generate profitable sales with a smaller asset investment, then it will be rewarded with a higher valuation. This measure is also useful when tracked on a trend line, so that one can see if there are any sudden jumps in asset investments that the company has made to incrementally bring in more sales.</p>
                    <p>Divide net sales for a full year by the total amount of fixed assets. There are several variations on this formula. One is to calculate annualized net sales on a rolling basis, so that the last 12 months of revenue are always used. This can be a better approach than attempting to extrapolate revenues forward for several months, especially if future revenues are uncertain. The denominator in the calculation, which is the amount of total fixed assets, may be used net of depreciation or before depreciation; the most common usage is after depreciation, since this is more indicative of the actual value of the assets.</p>

                  <p>A key issue is how much overhead expense is needed to maintain a certain level of sales volume. It is important to ensure that the administrative expense is carefully controlled, so that it does not have an excessively large impact on profits.

Also, the expense figure in the denominator should include the cost of the sales department, especially if its cost is largely fixed (as is the case when the sales staff has a high proportion of salaries to commissions).</p>

                  <p>The sales backlog ratio cannot be determined strictly from any standard financial statements, since the backlog is normally included only in internal management reports. If the backlog information is available, this ratio should be used as an extremely useful tool for determining a company’s ability to maintain its current level of production.

                    <p> If the ratio is dropping rapidly over several consecutive months, then it is likely that the company will soon experience a reduction in sales volume as well as over-capacity in its production and related overhead areas, resulting in imminent losses. Conversely, a rapid jump in the ratio indicates that a company cannot keep up with demand, and it may soon have customer relations problems from delayed orders and need additional capital expenditures and staff hirings to increase its productive capacity.</p>
                    <p>Divide the most current total backlog of sales orders by sales. It is generally best not to use annualized sales in the denominator, since sales may vary considerably over that period, due to the influence of seasonality. A better denominator is sales over just the preceding quarter.</p>

                  <p>This ratio is useful for determining the approximate interest rate that a company is paying on its debt. An analyst can use this information to see if a company is paying unusually high interest, which can be indicative of financial difficulties that are leading lenders to charge inordinately high rates of interest.

                    <p>The reason this ratio is called the working capital ratio comes from the working capital calculation. When current assets exceed current liabilities, the firm has enough capital to run its day-to-day operations. In other words, it has enough capital to work. The working capital ratio transforms the working capital calculation into a comparison between current assets and current liabilities.</p>

                  <h5>Accounting</h5>
                  <p>Compound annual growth rate or CAGR is a financial investment calculation that measures the percentage an investment increases or decreases year over year. You can think of this as the annual average rate of return for an investment over a period of time.

                    <p>Since most investments’ annual returns vary from year to year, the CAGR calculation averages the good years’ and bad years’ returns into one return percentage that investors and management can use to make future financial decisions.</p>
                    <p>CAGR formula is calculated by first dividing the ending value of the investment by the beginning value to find the total growth rate. This is then taken to the Nth root where the N is the number of years money has been invested. Finally, one is subtracted from product to arrive at the compound annual growth rate percentage.</p>

                  <h5>Accounting</h5>
                  <p>The contribution margin, sometimes used as a ratio, is the difference between a company's total sales revenue and variable costs. In other words, the contribution margin equals the amount that sales exceed variable costs. This is the sales amount that can be used to, or contributed to, pay off fixed costs.

                    <p>The concept of this equation relies on the difference between fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are production costs that remain the same as production efforts increase. Variable costs, on the other hand, increase with production levels.</p>
                    <p>The contribution margin measures how efficiently a company can produce products and maintain low levels of variable costs. It is considered a managerial ratio because companies rarely report margins to the public. Instead, management uses this calculation to help improve internal procedures in the production process.</p>
                    <p>The contribution margin is calculated by subtracting total variable costs from total sales revenue.</p>

                  <p>Cost of goods sold, often abbreviated COGS, is a managerial calculation that measures the direct costs incurred in producing products that were sold during a period. In other words, this is the amount of money the company spent on labour, materials, and overhead to manufacture or purchase products that were sold to customers during the year.

                    <p>The COGS formula is particularly important for management because it helps them analyse how well purchasing and payroll costs are being controlled. Creditors and investors also use cost of goods sold to calculate the gross margin of the business and analyse what percentage of revenues is available to cover operating expenses.</p>
                    <p>Both manufacturers and retailers list cost of good sold on the income statement as an expense directly after the total revenues for the period. COGS is then subtracted from the total revenue to arrive at the gross margin.</p>
                    <p>The cost of goods sold formula is calculated by adding purchases for the period to the beginning inventory and subtracting the ending inventory for the period.</p>

                    <p>First, external auditors will require that an obsolescence reserve be set up against these items, which will lower the inventory value and create a charge against current earnings. Second, constantly monitoring the level of obsolescence allows a company to work on eliminating the inventory through such means as returns to suppliers, taxable donations, and reduced-price sales to customers. Finally, obsolete inventory takes up valuable warehouse space that could otherwise be put to other uses; monitoring it with the obsolete inventory percentage allows management to eliminate these items to reduce space requirements.</p>
                    <p>Summarize the cost of all inventory items having no recent use, and divide by the total inventory valuation. The amount used in the numerator is subject to some interpretation, since there may be an occasional use that will eventually use up the amount left in stock, despite the fact that it has not been used for some time. An alternative summarization method for the numerator that avoids this problem is to include only those inventory items that do not appear on any bill of material for a currently produced item.</p>

                <h3>Welcome</h3>
                <p>This short tutorial will show you how to use the KansasDynamics Calculators web application to its fullest potential and how to navigate around the user interface.</p>
                <p>There are 8 parts to this tutorial and are as follows:</p>
                <p>Tabbed Navigation<br>Search Filters<br>FormuCards<br>Formulas<br>Information<br>Legends<br>Calculators</p><br><br>
              </div>
              <div class="item">
                <h3>Tabbed Navigation</h3>
                <p>This entire web application is loaded on a single page of HTML which means once it loads, there is absolutely no delay when navigating throughout the various sections of the website.</p>
                <br><img src="img/tutorial/tabbed-nav-large.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br>
                <p>The database of financial formulas is divided into 5 sections; Financial, Business, Realty, Accounting, and Logistics. On devices with smaller screens, the labels from each navigation tab will disappear, but by looking at the subtitle of any FormuCard, you will be able to determine the section you are currently in.</p>
                <br><img src="img/tutorial/tabbed-nav-small.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br><br>
              </div>
              <div class="item">
                <h3>Search Filters</h3>
                <p>Each section contains its own local filter. Underneath each search bar is a counter that tells you how many FormuCards are currently visible in the section.</p>
                <br><img src="img/tutorial/search-filter-blank.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br>
                <p>The filter works in real time by hiding any FormuCards that do not contain the keywords specified in the search box.</p>
                <br><img src="img/tutorial/search-filter-result.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br>
                <p>If there are no FormuCards that contain any keywords that match your search query, then the section will become blank and the counter will denote that 0 results were found.</p>
                <br><img src="img/tutorial/search-filter-failure.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br><br>
              </div>
              <div class="item">
                <h3>FormuCards</h3>
                <p>The FormuCard is the star of the show. It is a collection of many important parts that will help you understand and utilize financial formulas. Each part will be covered in the following sections, but this is what the FormuCard looks like.</p>
                <br><img src="img/tutorial/formucard.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br>
                <p>At the top is the actual formula, then below is the name of the formula, underneath is the subtitle denoting the section that FormuCard is found in, then there is detailed information, and at the bottom there are two icons symbolising the legend and calculator.</p><br><br>
              </div>
              <div class="item">
                <h3>Formulas</h3>
                <p>Most of the time specialised calculators are desired when available, but sometimes we need a raw formula to work with, and what would a reference application be without that?</p>
                <br><img src="img/tutorial/formula.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br>
                <p>At the top of each FormuCard is its formula. The formula can often contain plain English words or variables depending on its size. If the formula contains acronyms and simple variables, you may refer to the legend to understand their meaning.</p><br><br>
              </div>
              <div class="item">
                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>The bulk of your knowledge will come from the information section of each FormuCard. Due to size restrictions, only a brief summary of each formula is included, however, upon clicking the triangle icon at the end of each initial paragraph, the card will expand and display more detailed information.</p>
                <br><img src="img/tutorial/information.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br>
                <p>You must click the triangle icon again to hide the expanded information if you wish to close it.</p><br><br>
              </div>
              <div class="item">
                <h3>Legends</h3>
                <p>Sometimes a formula may use single letter variables or acronyms in order to save space and allow for a more legible image. Whether letters or full words are used in the formulas, each FormuCard has its own legend for reference.</p>
                <p>Click on the marker icon in the bottom corner of the card to see a pop-over legend.</p>
                <br><img src="img/tutorial/legend.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br>
                <p>The same marker icon must be again clicked in order to make the pop-over disappear, otherwise it will stay open indefinitely.</p><br><br>
              </div>
              <div class="item">
                <h3>Calculators</h3>
                <p>Arguably the best part of KansasDynamics Calculators is the fact that each FormuCard comes with its own customised calculator. Following the formulas, each calculator allows you to input your numeric data into pre-defined boxes and KansasDynamics Calculators will calculate your data in real time while displaying the result at the bottom of the window.</p>
                <br><img src="img/tutorial/calculator.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br>
                <p>To open each calculator, click on the calculator icon in the bottom corner of the FormuCard and a full-screen modal window will appear. To close the modal calculator, click on the &times; character in the top right corner of the screen in the purple title bar (not shown in this picture).</p><br><br>
